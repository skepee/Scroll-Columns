# Scroll-Columns
Imagine you have a grid with many many (many!!!) columns...
How do you scroll? By using scrollbar, normally... 
In this page you can scroll columns horizontally (forward and back) directly on the cell element you have the focus.
It does not matter how long is the cell, it scrolls automatically in the exact point of the next (or previous) element.

# Scroll - Columns - Highlight row and column
This version highlights the entire column and row of the selected element. Also navigation is showed.
 - When you scroll with focus on the header, the entire column is highlighted.
 - When you scroll with focus on the row, the entire row is highlighted.
