# Scroll-Columns
Imagine you have a grid with many many (many!!!) columns...
How do you scroll? By using scrollbar, normally... 
In this page you can scroll columns horizontally (forward and back) directly on the cell element you have the focus.
It does not matter how long is the cell, it scrolls automatically in the exact point of the next (or previous) element.
